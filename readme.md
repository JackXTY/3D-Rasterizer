# 3D-Rasterizer

This project is a 3D-rasterizer with a movavle camera, where you could load obj file and see how it looks like in different angles.
Besides, I also implment MSAA algorithms for anti-aliasing effect, and a line mode to see the object structure.

It comes from a course project in my UPenn master course, using C++ and Qt platform, without using openGL or other graphics API to draw objects directly.
With given basic skeleton, I implemented all of the core logic of rasterization, i.e. the class Rasterizer and Camera.
