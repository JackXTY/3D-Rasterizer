# 3D-Rasterizer

This project is a 3D-rasterizer, where you could load obj file and it would be drawn.
I also implment MSAA algorithms for anti-aliasing effect.

It comes from a course project in my master course, using C++ and Qt platform, without using openGL or other graphics API to draw objects directly.

In this project, with given basic skeleton, I implemented all of the core logic of rasterization, i.e. the class Rasterizer and Camera.
